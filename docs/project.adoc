= Project

== Create

We start this tutorial by using our TypeScript starter.

It comes with everything you need to start writing tests with Jest.

TIP: If you want to learn how to add Jest to an existing project, read the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/starter-ts/stable/test[Testing] chapter of the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/starter-ts/stable[TypeScript Starter] documentation.

To create a project for the tutorial, run the following command:

[source, Terminal]
----
enonic project create jest-tutorial -r starter-ts
----

This will create an app and place it in a folder called `jest-tutorial`.

== TL;DR

If you just want to read the tutorial, but not actually edit any files, you can create a project with the tutorial code already in place.

[source, Terminal]
----
enonic create myproject -r tutorial-jest
----

== Summary

In the next chapter we will learn how to write a simple <<test#,test>> without any mocks.
