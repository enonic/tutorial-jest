= Coverage
:toc: right

== Command line

To get a nice test coverage report when running tests, simply add the `--coverage` option:

[source, shell]
----
npx jest --coverage
----

== package.json

To get test coverage report every time you run

[source, shell]
----
npm test
----

just add the `--coverage` option in the `package.json` 's `scripts` section like this:

.package.json
[source, json]
----
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest --no-cache --coverage"
  }
}
----

This also enables the `npm test` in the <<#github_action, Github action>> below to produce a coverage report for <<#codecov, Codecov>>.

== Codecov

https://about.codecov.io/[Codecov,window=_blank,opts=nofollow] is a nice reporting tool that can be used to visualize your test coverage across multiple projects. It integrates nicely with GitHub and other CI/CD tools.


== GitHub action

Here is an example of how to set up a GitHub action to automatically send your test coverage to Codecov:

CAUTION: Make sure the `npm test` command produces a coverage report. This is done by adding the `--coverage` option to the `jest` command as described <<#package_json, above>>
