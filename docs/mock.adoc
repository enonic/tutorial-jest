= Simple mock
:sourcedir: ../

== Source code

To demonstrate the power of mocking, we'll make a simple typescript wrapper around an Enonic Java library:

.src/main/resources/lib/tutorial-jest/sanitize.ts
[source, typescript]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/main/resources/lib/tutorial-jest/sanitize.ts[]
----

== Test without mock

If you try running this simple test:

[source, typescript]
----
import {
    describe,
    expect,
    test as it
} from '@jest/globals';
import { sanitize } from './sanitize';


describe('sanitize', () => {
    it('should return the first 10 numbers in the fibonacci sequence', () => {
        expect(sanitize("Piña CØLADÆ <script>alert('hi!');</script>"))
            .toEqual('pina-coladae-script-alerthi-script');
    });
});
----

It will fail with the following error message:

[source, shell]
----
Cannot find module '/lib/xp/common' from 'src/main/resources/lib/tutorial-jest/sanitize.ts'
----

This happens because the module file `/lib/xp/common` isn't available in the test environment. It only exists inside the application jar file, which is used at runtime in the Enonic XP server.

So we have to "fake" it.
