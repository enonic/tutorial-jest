== Node modules

In order to write tests in Typescript and run them using Jest, a bunch of node modules needs to be installed.

Run the following command at the root of the project:

[source, shell]
----
npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom ts-node ts-jest
----

== Configuration

=== jest.config.ts

Jest needs to be configured to run Typescript tests. This is done by creating a `jest.config.ts` file in the root of the project:

.jest.config.ts
[source, Typescript]
----
include::{sourcedir}jest.config.ts[]
----

Read more about configuring Jest here: https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration

=== tsconfig.json

In an Enonic Typescript project there can be both server-side and client-side code. In order for such code to be properly type checked and compiled, multiple `tsconfig.json` files are used.

When running tests the Typescript configuration files might need to look slightly different. This is the case for the `test/client/tsconfig.json` and `test/server/tsconfig.json` files:

.test/client/tsconfig.json
[source, json]
----
include::{sourcedir}test/client/tsconfig.json[]
----

.test/server/tsconfig.json
[source, json]
----
include::{sourcedir}test/server/tsconfig.json[]
----

== Execution

=== package.json

In order to run tests the following needs to be added to the `package.json` file:

.package.json
[source, json]
----
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest --no-cache --coverage"
  }
}
----

=== build.gradle

The Enonic XP framework uses gradle to build libraries and applications.

In order to run the tests on every build, add the following to the `build.gradle` file:

.build.gradle
[source, gradle]
----
tasks.register('npmTest', NpmTask) {
    args = [
        'run',
        'test'
    ]
    dependsOn npmInstall
    environment = [
        'FORCE_COLOR': 'true',
    ]
    inputs.dir 'test'
    outputs.dir 'coverage'
}

test.dependsOn npmTest
----

=== tsup/server.ts

In order to exclude the test files from being processed by the build system and copied from the source directory (`src/main/resources`) to the build directory (`build/resources/main`), an ignore pattern needs to be added to the `tsup/server.ts` file:

.tsup/server.ts
[source, Typescript]
----
const FILES_SERVER = globSync(
  `${DIR_SRC}/${AND_BELOW}/*.${GLOB_EXTENSIONS_SERVER}`,
  {
    absolute: false,
    ignore: globSync(`${DIR_SRC_ASSETS}/${AND_BELOW}/*.${GLOB_EXTENSIONS_SERVER}`).concat(
      globSync(`${DIR_SRC_STATIC}/${AND_BELOW}/*.${GLOB_EXTENSIONS_SERVER}`),
      globSync(`${DIR_SRC}/${AND_BELOW}/*.${TEST_EXT}`), // Avoid compiling test files
    )
  }
).map(s => s.replaceAll('\\', '/')); // Windows compatibility
----

== Summary

With the above setup in place, it is possible to write tests in Typescript and run them using Jest.
The tests will be run on every build and the coverage will be reported.
